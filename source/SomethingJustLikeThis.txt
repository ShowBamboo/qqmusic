[00:08.16]I've been reading books of old
[00:10.44]The legends and the myths
[00:12.79]Achilles and his gold
[00:15.10]Hercules and his gifts
[00:17.60]Spiderman's control
[00:19.88]And Batman with his fists
[00:22.20]
[00:22.82]And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
[00:26.46]She said where'd you wanna go
[00:28.98]How much you wanna risk
[00:31.25]I'm not looking for somebody
[00:33.41]With some Superhuman gifts
[00:36.08]Some Superhero
[00:37.78]
[00:38.39]Some fairytale bliss
[00:40.83]Just something I can turn to
[00:43.05]Somebody I can kiss
[00:45.12]I want something just like this
[00:47.69]Doo doo doo doo doo doo

[01:22.85]I've been reading books of old
[01:24.52]
[01:25.03]The legends and the myths
[01:27.34]The testaments they told
[01:29.69]The moon and its eclipse
[01:32.04]And Superman unrolls
[01:34.38]A suit before he lifts
[01:36.64]
[01:37.69]But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
[01:40.92]She said where'd you wanna go
[01:43.75]How much you wanna risk
[01:45.79]I'm not looking for somebody
